# Salatiel's Public Notes

This is a repository where I'll be updating while watching courses or reading books.

> Don't expect much in terms of structure or sense-making. Expect miss-spelling words, sentences with grammatical mistakes and lots of typos. Some will be easily understandable others not so much. Some will be finished others not even half. I'm not writing this notes for anyone else than me. So if helps someone that's great but is not the purpose of it.

**Notes can be pure text, rich text or even code snippets**

## Why

- I learned that note taking helps me better organize and understand the topics I'm studying it.

- When studying complex concepts I like to writing it down what I understood with my own words that helps me memorize it

- It helps me concentrate on the content I'm watching/reading

- Improve english writing

- Lastly it gives me a sense of "This learning is going somewhere I can see" not just my mind which I can easily forget.
