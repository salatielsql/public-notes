# Blockchain generations

1. First generation: Bitcoin
2. Second generation: Ethereum ( A global computer to run code securely )
3. Third generation: Cardano

> DeFi means (Decentralied Finances)

## Second generation

#### Ethereum's Six Principles

1. Atomicity
2. Synchrony
3. Provenance
4. Permanence
5. Immortality
6. Immutability

#### Smart contract

Is a computer program stored on a blockchain. Establish and run aggreements.

## Why a third generation

The previous generation challenges remin:

- Scalability
- Interoperability
- Sustainability

Third-generation blockchains, like Cardano, work to address these issues.

### Third generation blockchains requirements

- Interoperability - The ability to easily transfer value from one blockchain to another
- Sustainability - The ability of a blockchain to maintain itself and operate in an environmenttlly response manner

### The blockchain trilemma

Derived from Eric Brewer a distriuted systems theory. That says only 2 of 3 compnents in a distribuied system can be archived.

This is the trilemma.

- Decentralziation
- Securty
- Scalability

So third-generation blockchains work to make theses 3 available

> Even developer-derived tokens from a Cardano native token (ADA) is a considered native token.

## Blockchain layer architecture

1. Layer 1 - is the blockchain itself - the base network
2. Layer 2 - refers to the structures built upon the base layer
3. Layer 3 - ?????
